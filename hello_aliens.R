Dear Aliens. I hope you are well. Earth is a cool place, but it can be a not too cool place at times. We have a lot of people on earth. Some people are good, some people are bad. But I guess that's what makes life interesting. But, life can be uninteresting at times too (like this message). To be honest, earth is actually pretty uncool. I'm more interested in knowing what it is like out there, where you live. Do you have a president or a leader? Do you have money? How many genders exist where you live? Do you have to go to school? Do you know about earth? Are we all just a simulation created by you? I think that's good for now. Hope to hear from you soon.")
